This repository is a mirror of [my competitive programming site](http://competitive-programming.seangillen.com). It is primarily intended for reference by myself and other members of the programming team at the University of Alabama, but anyone is welcome to find it useful.

## Sites for problems
* [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com)
* [CodeChef](https://codechef.com)
* [Spoj](https://spoj.com)
* [Code Drills](https://code-drills.com) will recommend problems from the above based on your past submissions

## Books
* [Competitive Programming 3](https://cpbook.net/) by Steven & Felix Halim
* [Competitive Programmer's Handbook](https://cses.fi/book.pdf) by Antti Laaksonen
* [Guide to Competitive Programming](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319725468) by Antti Laaksonen

## Compiling & running solutions
The commands below emulate how submissions are compiled and run at competitions and practice sites (some flags that shouldn't affect a solution's correctness unless you're doing something *very* strange are omitted for brevity):
* C++: `g++ -std=c++14 -O2 solution.cpp && ./a.out < input.txt`
* C: `gcc -O2 solution.c && ./a.out < input.txt`
* Java: `javac Solution.java && java Solution < input.txt`
* Python 3: `python3 solution.py < input.txt`
* Python 2: `python2 solution.py < input.txt`
* Perl: `perl solution.pl < input.txt`

Use `-g` for gcc/g++ to get additional debugging information out of your runtime errors.

All solutions (even Java) must be one file.
